# Karplus-Strong-Algorithm
Simulate the plucking of a guitar string  using the Karplus-Strong algorithm.

This project involves implementing a queue ADT to simulate the plucking of a guitar string using the Karplus-Strong algorithm, a foundational technique in physically modeled sound synthesis. Students will define a queue (DblQueue.java) to hold double values and a class (GuitarString.java) representing a guitar string that utilizes this queue. The main task is to complete GuitarHero.java, which reads note information from a text file and generates a .dat sound file based on specified frequencies and timings. The program models the vibration of guitar strings filled with random noise to simulate plucking and uses a linked list for the queue implementation. Testing is emphasized for both the DblQueue and GuitarString classes before integrating them into the main program to ensure functionality aligns with specified APIs. The outcome is a synthesized sound file demonstrating the Karplus-Strong algorithm's application, tested and verified through manual input and output file management, adhering to specific input validation and output formatting requirements.
